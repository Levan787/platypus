# platypus

In that assignment we had to create little game platypus which include class, some data ( age, weight, name, gender, mutant), 
functions: eat which increases platypus weight, age which increases platypus age and calculating its death age, 
fight which determines who winner is and start fight between 2 platypus;
There are some exclusions, for example, platypus who is dead, cannot eat, fight or increase age.
